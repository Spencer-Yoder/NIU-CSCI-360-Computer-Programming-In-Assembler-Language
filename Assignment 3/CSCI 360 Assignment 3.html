    *100 points *

*Overview*

For this assignment, write a program that will produce a sales report
for a company called Widgets-R-Us. They are offering discounts and free
shipping for sufficiently large orders.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Input*

The input to the program will be a file with an unknown number of
records. Each record represents a single sale and has the following format:

     columns         description
     -------         -----------
      1 - 6          Product ID
      7 - 8          spaces
      9 - 15         Order ID
     16 - 17         spaces
     18 - 20         Number Ordered
     21 - 22         spaces         
     23 - 26         Price Each (in cents)
     27 - 80         spaces

Use the following JCL statement to specify the input file:

//FT05F001  DD  DSN=KC02314.SPRING18.CSCI360.HW3DATA,DISP=SHR

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Processing Requirements*

For this assignment, write a read loop that will process the input one
record at a time.

For each input record, print a detail line containing the input values
along with the Discount, Shipping and Total Cost (in cents).

Use the following formulas for your calculations:

     PreTotal = Price Each * Number Ordered

     If (PreTotal >= 20000)
       Then Discount = 500
       Else Discount = 0
     End If

     If (PreTotal >= 10000)
       Then Shipping = 0
       Else Shipping = 600
     End If

     Total Cost = PreTotal + Shipping - Discount

As you process records, count them and accumulate the Grand Total = sum
of Total Cost for all sales. Also count sales for which Shipping = 0.

After processing all of the input records, print summary lines which
tell us the number of sales, the number of sales with Shipping = 0, the
Grand Total and the average Total Cost per Sale.

The average Total Cost should be rounded to the nearest cent. One
possible way to do this is, after doing the division, calculate 2 times
the remainder and compare that product with the divisor. If 2 * the
remainder is greater than or equal to the divisor, then the quotient
should be rounded up up by 1.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Other Requirements*

 1.

    Use |TITLE 'Your Name, CSCI 360, Program 3'|.

 2.

    Use |M, D, MR, DR, LA, XREAD, XDECI, XDECO, XPRNT, L, ST, C, A, S,
    AR, SR, BC| and |BCR|, as appropriate.

 3.

    Use at least one literal in the program.

 4.

    You should use line documentation, documentation boxes, and you are
    welcome to use |EJECT|, and |SPACE|. You will be using various
    registers, and you do need to make a list of how you are using them.

 5.

    Write this program incrementally. This will make it much easier to
    debug. Initially write the program so that it reads and processes
    one record. Once you know it does that correctly, implement the
    loop. Once the loop is working correctly, add the code to count the
    sales, count those with free Shipping, etc.

 6.

    You may find that you run short of registers if your try to use them
    for all your variables. You can use fullwords in memory for some
    purposes such as counters. When you want to increment the counter,
    load it into a register, add 1 and store it again. That register is
    not then tied up and can be used for other purposes.

 7.

    The JCL for the program should now look like:

    //your_KC_id_plus_a_letter JOB ,'your name',MSGCLASS=H
    //STEP1 EXEC PGM=ASSIST
    //STEPLIB DD DSN=KC02293.ASSIST.LOADLIB,DISP=SHR
    //SYSPRINT DD SYSOUT=*
    //SYSIN DD *
    ********************************************
    *
    *  The documentaton goes here.
    *
    ********************************************
    /*
    //FT05F001 DD DSN=KC02314.SPRING18.CSCI360.HW3DATA,DISP=SHR
    //

 8.

    When you are debugging logic errors, don't be reluctant to use XDUMP
    instructions to display registers and/or memory. Once you get the
    program running, remove the XDUMPs from the run that is turned in
    for grading.

    Feel free to test the program with your own data. To do so,
    temporarily replace the JCL line that starts with "//FT05F001" by

         //FT05F001 DD *
         your data goes here 
         /*

    Make sure that the run you submit for grading uses the file
    specified above.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Other Notes*

The page header for the report should start at the top of a new page.
The column headers should be double spaced from the page header. The
sales information lines should be double spaced. The summary lines
should be triple spaced from the last sales record. Double-space between
summary lines.

Notice that we are printing amounts of money simply as numbers of cents.
Later in the course, we will have ways to format numbers more precisely.

You may need to put a label on a line now and then when you are not yet
sure what instruction should be on that line. In that case, you can just
use:

     MYLABEL  DS   0H

The "DS 0H" part allocates zero halfwords on a halfword boundary.
Instruction are always on a halfword boundary anyway, so this does no
harm and simply associates MYLABEL with an address. The next line will
be at the same LOC value.
