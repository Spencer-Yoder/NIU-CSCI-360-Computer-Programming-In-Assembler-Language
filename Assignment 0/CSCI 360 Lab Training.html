The purpose of this lab session is to introduce you to TSO so that you
will be able to submit and run Assembly language programs throughout the
term.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Step One: Connect to the Marist system*

Open the Vista TN3270 emulator from the start menu.

Enter the following values in the dialog box that appears and then
select “Connect”:

*Host:* zos.kctr.marist.edu
*Port:* 1023

After you have successfully connected to the Marist system, you will see
a welcome screen with a flashing cursor. Type in “L TSO” (no quotes).

You should now be at the screen to enter your id number. This is where
you will type in the KC-id that was provided by your instructor. Press
Enter.

A new screen should appear with an option to enter your password. Your
initial password is the same as your KC-id number. After you have typed
in the initial password, tab over to the New Password option and enter a
new password. It must be _exactly_ 8 characters in length and made up of
letters and digits. Press Enter. You will then be prompted to re-enter
your new password. Do so and press Enter again.

After the 3 asterisks, type _ispfinit_ if this is the first time that
you've logged in to TSO or just _ispf_ if you have logged in before.
Press Enter. (You only need to do this once.)

Congratulations! You are now fully logged on to the Marist system.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Step Two: Create a data set to hold your programs*

Before you can start to write an Assembly language program, you must
first create a data set that will hold all of your programs. This is
what is called a "partitioned data set" or "PDS". It is similar to a
folder or a directory in Windows or UNIX. To do this, select option 3
(Utilities) from the ISPF Primary Option Menu by typing 3 after the
Option ===>. Press Enter. You should now be at the Utility Selection
Panel. Enter option 2 (Data Set) after the Option ===>. Press Enter.

On the Data Set Utility screen, use the Tab key or the mouse to move to
the different fields:

  * enter A after the Option ===> so that you can allocate a data set
  * *Project:* Type in your KC-id number
  * *Group:* Type in a Group Name: it can be whatever you like, but
    maybe try something like CSCI360
  * *Type:* Pick a library name, maybe something like ASSIGNS 

Once all of the information has been entered, press Enter.

On the Allocate New Data Set screen, enter the following values:
Space Units 	TRKS
Primary Quantity 	15
Secondary Quantity 	15
Directory Blocks 	12
Record Format 	FB
Record Length 	80
Block Size 	4000
Data Set Name Type 	PDS

Leave the other options with the default values. Press Enter. You should
now see the message “Data Set Allocated” in the upper right hand corner.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Step Three: Create a data set to hold your output files*

Now let's allocate a second partitioned data set that can be used to
hold output files. On the Data Set Utility screen, again, use the Tab
key or the mouse to move to the different fields:

  * enter A after the Option ===> so that you can allocate a data set
  * *Project:* Type in your KC-id number (if it's not already filled in)
  * *Group:* Type in a Group Name (if it's not already filled in, make
    it the same thing as above)
  * *Type:* Pick a library name, maybe something like OUTPUT 

Once all of the information has been entered, press Enter.

On the Allocate New Data Set screen, enter the following values:
Space Units 	TRKS
Primary Quantity 	15
Secondary Quantity 	15
Directory Blocks 	12
Record Format 	VB
Record Length 	134
Block Size 	4000
Data Set Name Type 	PDS

Leave the other options with the default values. Press Enter. You should
now see the message “Data Set Allocated” in the upper right hand corner.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Step Four: Write your program*

Before we can write the program, we have to provide a name for the file.

At the Option ===> prompt, type =2. The Edit Entry Panel screen will
appear. For Project, enter your KC-id number. For Group, enter the group
name that you used previously (CSCI360). For Type, enter the library
name that you used previously (ASSIGNS). For Member, pick a file name –
you can name your programs whatever you would like but for today, use
LAB. Press Enter.

You should now be at the editing screen. Continually press the Tab key
or use the mouse until you are to the right of the first line of …...
This is the first line of your file.

Type in the following program:

/_*NOTE:*_/ After typing the first line of the program and pressing
Enter, it's possible that the BOTTOM OF DATA line of starts will appear.
If this happens, use the mouse and click on the line number next to the
first line (most likely 0001000), place an 'I' (no quotes) anywhere in
the number and press Enter, this will allow you to 'Insert' data.

Make sure to make the following replacements in the code:

  * your_id with your KC-id number followed by a single letter
  * your name with your name 

//your_id JOB ,'your name',MSGCLASS=H
//STEP1 EXEC PGM=ASSIST
//STEPLIB DD DSN=KC02293.ASSIST.LOADLIB,DISP=SHR
//SYSPRINT DD SYSOUT=*
//SYSIN DD *
********************************************
* EXAMPLE PROGRAM
*
* NAME:  your name here
*
* Register Usage
*
*  2     Total 
*  5     Counter
* 15     Base register
*
********************************************
MAIN     CSECT
         USING MAIN,15
         SR    3,3     ZERO FOR TOTAL
         SR    6,6     ZERO FOR COUNTER
         XDUMP
         BR    14
         END   MAIN
/*
//

The //, *, MAIN, and /* should all start in column 1. The USING, SR,
XDUMP, BR, and END should all start in column 10. The MAIN (after
USING), 3, 6, 14, and MAIN (after END) should start in column 16. Use
the space bar to line up the information. /_*Do not use TAB in mainframe
files.*_/

A common error here is to leave out the letter after your KC number in
the JOB line. The value here is called the _job name_ and must be 8
characters long. (a KC number is 7 characters long). If you do not
supply the letter, you will be asked for it later.

After the program is typed in, use the mouse to go to COMMAND ===> and
type in SAVE. Your dataset should now be saved. It is also a good idea
to get into the habit of saving your program as you type as programs get
longer.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Step Five: Run the program and look at the output*

To submit the file to run, type SUBMIT or SUB at the COMMAND===> . You
should see a message toward the bottom of the screen that your JOB has
been submitted. Take note of the JOB number (such as JOB01234) that is
inside of the parenthesis.

Press Enter to return to your code. You now have two options to get to
view output: 1) press the F3 button until you return to the ISPF Primary
Option menu and then select option SD (SDSF) or 2) enter =SD at the
COMMAND===> prompt and press Enter.

Type OWNER followed by your KC-id number at the COMMAND INPUT prompt.
Press Enter. /*(You only need to do this once, the first time you use
option SD.)*/ If you forget to do this, you will get a list of
everyone's output files, not just your own.

Select option STATUS or ST. Press Enter. You should now see all of the
tasks/jobs that are owned by you.

Find the JOB number that matches the one that was displayed when the
program was submitted (usually the last one) and type S or SE to the
left of the name. Press Enter. The only difference between the two
options is that SE will allow you to edit the output file. (You seldom
want to edit it.)

The output produced by your Assembly code should now be open. To view
the output, page down until you see your code by continuously pressing
the F8 key or the Page Down key (if it works). The output of the program
will be at the end of the file. It's two lines, both of which start with
REGS. If you don't see the lines, something is wrong with your program
and you need to go back and make changes to your program file and repeat
the submission process.

If the output is correct, let's save it to the OUTPUT directory that was
created earlier. If you're still viewing the output, press F3 to return
to the job listing page.

If you want to save an output file, type XDC to the left of the file you
want to save and press Enter. On the SDSF Open Print Data Set Panel,
enter the following, making sure to use the names you chose earlier:

  * Data Set Name: KC-id.CSCI360.OUTPUT
  * Member to Use: whatever name you want, maybe something like LABOUT
  * Disposition: OLD 

Verify that the file values match what was entered earlier:
Space Units 	TRKS
Primary Quantity 	10
Secondary Quantity 	10
Record Format 	VB
Record Length 	134

A common minor error we sometimes see here is that the Data Set Name is
shown as "KC-id.KC-id.CSCI360.OUTPUT", that is, the KC-id is listed
twice. If this happens, fix it by deleting one of them.

Press Enter. Your output file has now been created and you should be
back at the JOB listings. The file that was created can be FTP'd to your
local machine if you would like to print it or view it with an editor on
your local machine. We'll cover this later.

To delete an output file, put a P to the left of the job number and
follow the directions. You should make it a habit of purging your jobs
when you're done looking at the output.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*End the session*

Once you have finished using the Marist system, press the F3 key until
you get back to the ISPF Primary Option Menu. Press F3 once again. You
will either exit the ISPF system and see the main TSO command line, or
see the Specify Disposition of Log Data Set.

Press 2 to delete your history information about this session. The word
READY should appear in the upper left hand corner. Type LOGOFF to logoff
of the Marist system. /_*It is important that you logoff when you are
done. Don't just close the window.*_/

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Some TSO tidbits*

If you would like to see a list of the files that you have on your
account, from the ISPF Primary Options Menu, select option 3
(Utilities). The Utility Selection Panel should now be showing. Select
option 4 (Dslist) from the menu. Press Enter. At the DSNNAME LEVEL
field, type in your KC-id number and press Enter. You should now see a
listing of all of the files that belong to you. There should be a number
of files. Search through the list until you see the one with the names
that you entered earlier. You may have to use the F8 button to page down
if there are too many files to fit on one screen.

To edit the file, type “E” (no quotes) to the left of the file name. You
can either tab down to the file name or click with your mouse. The EDIT
Entry Panel should now be open. Press Enter. The data set is now open.

To delete the file, type “D” (no quotes) to the left of the file name
and Press Enter. The data set should have a “Deleted” message after the
name.

The ISPF environment can be very useful. You can, for instance, toggle
between two screens. There is a link from our course web page to a
tutorial.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*FTP*

The output file and source code files from earlier can be FTP'd to your
local machine by starting any FTP program (Filezilla, mar_ftp, etc.).
Set up a connection to Marist using the information (zos.kctr.marist.edu
and KC-id number) from earlier, as well as your password. Do not change
the Port number.

For most of the FTP programs, you should see your local files on the
left side of the screen and your Marist files on the right side of the
screen. Find your output file (KC-id.CSCI360.OUTPUT will probably look
like a folder that you can click on). After clicking on the folder, you
should see a file with the same name that you entered for the “Member to
Use” option above (maybe LABOUT). Transfer the file to your local
machine by double clicking the file name or highlighting it and
selecting the Download option.

The file is now saved on your local machine and can be opened in any
editor if you would like to view or print the output. This is also the
file that will be submitted to Blackboard.

Follow the same process to get your source code file.

You can also use FTP to send a file in the other direction. You can
write your program file at the NIU end. Save it as an absolutely plain
text file and give it a name (up to 8 characters) such as "PROG5". Send
it to the Marist site to be a member of the PDS called ASSIGNS. You
should now be able to access it using TSO.

The mar_ftp program is a tiny text-based program which makes use of the
Windows ftp program. It has a simple menu with only a few options. It
can be used the submit a job, check on its status, and fetch the output
file. It can also be used simply to fetch the output file after you run
the job using TSO. What mar_ftp does not do is delete the output files
from your Marist account, so you will need to log on to TSO to do this
for yourself.
