*Overview*

As in Assignment 6, we have a file containing various pieces of
information. In this case, however, the data is not all lined up for us
in neat columns. We will need to use TRT and EX to extract the data from
the record, and we will use TR to standardize the appearance of the names.

For this assignment, we will write a program that will read a file
containing information about the players of the Greek Myth game: ID
numbers, names and three scores for each person. The information will be
stored in a table. We will print the table.

The program will make use of external subroutines, character data and
packed decimal numbers.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Input*

The input to the program will be a file with an unknown number of
records. Each record represents a single client of player in the Greek
Myth game and has the following format:

Each input record contains:

     ID Number (always 8 digits)
     at least one space
     First Name (up to 10 characters)
     at least one space
     Last Name (up to 12 characters)
     at least one space
     three scores, each 1-3 digits, separated by at least 1 space
     more spaces to make up 80 columns in all

Use the following JCL statement to specify the input file:

//FT05F001  DD  DSN=KC02314.SPRING18.CSCI360.HW7DATA,DISP=SHR

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Processing Requirements*

The main program will carry out the following steps:

  * Call subroutine BUILD to read the file and store the data in a table.

    The arguments for BUILD are the address of the table and the address
    of a fullword that contains the address of the next available entry.

  * Call subroutine PRINT to print the contents of the table, using
    appropriate page and column headings.

    The arguments for PRINT are the address of the table, the address of
    a fullword that contains the address of the next available entry,
    the address of the caption to use in the page heading, and the
    address of the page counter.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Other Notes*

 1. Declare the table to hold 50 entries. Each entry should have the
    following format:
      * ID Number (stored as a fullword)
      * Last Name (12 characters)
      * First Name (10 characters)
      * Score 1 (2 packed decimal bytes)
      * Score 2 (2 packed decimal bytes)
      * Score 3 (2 packed decimal bytes) 

 2. Use this DSECT to describe a table entry:

         $ENTRY   DSECT
         $ID      DS    F
         $LNAME   DS    12C
         $FNAME   DS    10C
         $SCORE1  DS    PL2
         $SCORE2  DS    PL2
         $SCORE3  DS    PL2

 3. You may assume there no more than 50 players.

 4. The names are in a mixture of upper and lower case. You should use
    TR to put them in a standard format in which the first letter of
    each first or last name is an upper-case letter and that the other
    letters are lower-case.

 5. Write this program incrementally, one subroutine at a time. Start
    with BUILD and XDUMP the table to see whether BUILD is correct.
    After that, write and test PRINT.

 6. The JCL for this assignment is the same as the JCL used in
    Assignment 6 except for the line given above to provide the data.

 7. You may not use XDECI or XDECO anywhere in this assignment. The
    scores should all be stored in packed decimal format and the ID
    numbers should be stored as binary fullwords.

 8. When the table is printed, we will have a caption at the top of the
    page. The PRINT subroutine will have an extra argument, the address
    of a character field of length 24. When we call PRINT, the caption
    should be "Greek Myth: Player Data".

 9. As you work on this, you may need to XDUMP all or part of the table
    to check your work. Each line of XDUMP prints 32 bytes of data, and
    each table entry is 32 bytes long. Use the following ORG trick to
    line up your table on a 32-byte boundary:

              ORG PROG7+((*-PROG7+31)/32)*32)
    TABLE    DS  1600C

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Output*

The page header for each report should start at the top of a new page.
The page heading should be centered. The page heading should include a
page number (as in Assignment 6.)

The column headers should be triple-spaced from the page header.

The lines of player information should be double spaced.

Print no more than 20 lines of player information per page.

Print ID numbers as 8 digits with leading zeroes, as in "00123456".
