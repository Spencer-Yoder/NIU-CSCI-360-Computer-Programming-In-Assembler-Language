This assignment is in three parts:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Part A*

Write a program that does the following:

  * Declare a fullword FIRST with the value 113.
  * Declare a fullword SECOND with the value 52.
  * Subtract SECOND from FIRST. To do this, simply load these numbers
    into registers and use an SR.
  * Add FIRST to SECOND. To do this, load the two numbers into registers
    (a different pair of registers) and use an AR.
  * Now use an XDUMP to dump out the registers and look at the register
    values to see your answer. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Part B*

Modify the program from Part A as follows:

  * Declare two consecutive fullwords of storage called RESULT1 and
    RESULT2.
  * Store (ST) the first answer (FIRST minus SECOND) into RESULT1.
  * Store (ST) the second answer (SECOND plus FIRST) into RESULT2.
  * XDUMP that area of storage (containing RESULT1 and RESULT2) using
    XDUMP. You can use XDUMP to print the RESULTs in storage by using
    the label followed by the length of the field like this: XDUMP
    RESULT1,8.
  * Go into the XDUMP output and verify your math is correct. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Part C*

Now rewrite your program using explicit addressing. This means on the L
and ST, take out your labels and fill in the addresses of the various
fullwords. You can get these addresses from the program listing of part B.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Other Notes*

Hint: Start with the JCL and the trivial little program we had in the
lab training exercise. Take out the two SR lines and put in what you need.

Be sure your name and the assignment number (including Part A, B or C)
is included in the documentation for each file.

Turn in all three programs (from Parts A, B and C) and the output file
from Part C.
