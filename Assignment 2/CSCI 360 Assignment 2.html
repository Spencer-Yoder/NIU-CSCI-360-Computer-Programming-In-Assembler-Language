    *80 points *

For this assignment you will write a program that reads in an unknown
number of lines, each containing 4-digit numbers, 3 per line. For each
line read, print out the numbers X, Y and Z, calculate the value of X +
Y - Z and print the result.

Each line has the following format:

     columns 1-4    blank
     columns 5-8    first number X
     columns 9-11   blank
     columns 12-15  second number Y
     columns 16-18  blank
     columns 19-22  third number Z
     columns 23-80  blank

When all processing is done, print the sum of the result values from all
of the lines and the number of lines read.

Write your program incrementally! That means that you should begin by
just reading one record and print out those numbers. When that works,
put in a loop. If you get one part working before moving on to the next,
your debugging will be much easier and less time-consuming.

Use a top driven loop:

Initialize the counter and the total
     Top of the loop
      Read a record
      If end-of-file, branch to the end of the loop
      Deal with the record just read using XDECI, arithmetic, XDECO and XPRNT
      Add 1 to the counter
      Add the result (X + Y - Z) of the numbers read to the total
      Branch to the top of the loop
     End of the loop
     Use XDECO and XPRNT to print the summary lines

You will need to put labels on two lines, one for the top of the loop
and one for the bottom of the loop. You can actually put a label on any
line of code, but many people put them on lines that don't do anything
else, like this:

     MYLABEL  DS    0H

Here _DS 0H_ takes up no space. (It declares 0 halfwords on a halfword
boundary, and as each instruction is an even number of bytes, the
location will already be on a halfword boundary.)

As before, you will need to replace "Your Name" with your own name, and
you will need to replace "KCnumber" with your own logon ID.

Your actual code should be after the comment box and before the /* line.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Data*

As indicated above, the data is listed in the source code file between
the _FT05FT001_ line and the following _/*_ line.

This is known as _instream_ data. It is also possible to read from a
specific disk file by name, and we will do so later.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Other requirements*

In the JCL, at the very beginning of the program is a _comment box_.
Notice the place that says "Register Usage". Make a list here of
registers you used and how you made use of each one. For instance, you
will be using register 15 as your base register, and register 1 is used
by XDECI. Thus you might have:

*
*  Register usage:
*    1        Used by XDECI
*   15        Base register
*

and probably several more such lines.

The comment box should also list your name and the number of the
assignment (Assignment 2).

To use XREAD, you will need to have an 80-byte field to contain each
line you read.

To produce the output, you will need to define a couple of output lines
containing DC and DS statements (with labels on the DS statements).

Your program should include _line documentation_. At the end of each
line (certainly for most lines) skip one or more spaces and insert a few
words describing what that instruction does. Try to line these up so
they start in the same column. For instance:

         SR    3,3                     Initialize counter.
         SR    6,6                     Initialize total.

If you wish, you may use _register equates_. These allow you to refer to
register 3 as "R3" instead of just "3". To use these, include lines such as

     R0       EQU   0
     R1       EQU   1
              .
              .
              .
     R15      EQU   15

somewhere in your program file (such as at the end). You can read about
EQU in our textbook, section 2.11, or on one of the web pages. One
advantage of using the register equates is that you are reminded that a
number representing a register does just that and does not have some
other meaning. You are not required to use the register equates.

Name your program file something like "ASSIGN2" or "ASSIGN2".

Submit your program file and output file through Blackboard.
